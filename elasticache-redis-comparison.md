# ElastiCache Redis: Cluster Mode Enabled vs. Disabled

### Cluster Mode Disabled Benefits:
1. **Simpler Architecture**: Easier to set up and manage with a single shard
2. **Read Replicas**: Can have up to 5 read replicas for high availability and read scaling
3. **Cross-AZ Support**: Replicas can be in separate AZs for high availability with auto-failover
4. **Lower Latency**: Generally provides lower latency for single-key operations
5. **Easier Migration**: Simpler to migrate from self-managed Redis to ElastiCache

### Cluster Mode Enabled Benefits:
1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Allows you to partition your data across multiple shards (node groups)
2. **Higher Throughput**: Distributes workload across multiple shards for better performance
3. **Larger Dataset Support**: Can store significantly more data by distributing across multiple shards
4. **Online Resharding**: Supports adding or removing shards while the cluster continues to serve requests
5. **Better Workload Distribution**: Automatically distributes keys across shards using hash slots
6. **Higher Availability**: Data is distributed across multiple shards, reducing the impact of a single node failure
7. **Higher Memory Capacity**: Combined memory across all shards allows for larger datasets

### When to Choose Each Mode:

**Choose Cluster Mode Disabled when:**
- Your dataset is relatively small (fits in a single node)
- You need simple read scaling with replicas
- You want lower latency for single-key operations
- Your workload is read-heavy and can benefit from read replicas

**Choose Cluster Mode Enabled when:**
- Your dataset is large and exceeds the memory capacity of a single node
- You need to scale horizontally as your data grows
- You need higher throughput for write operations
- You want to distribute your workload across multiple shards
- You need the ability to scale in/out without downtime (online resharding)

The key difference is that cluster mode enabled provides horizontal scaling capabilities through data partitioning across multiple shards, while cluster mode disabled provides a simpler architecture with a single primary node and optional read replicas.
